            Any equipment (e.g. sticks, spare hankies, drums, stick bags, first aid kit and catering items) will first be offered to members for a reasonable market price.</li>
        </ol>

Any items not disposed of will be given to charity.</li>
      <li>The money in the bank account, which shall include all receipts from the disposal of equipment shall be donated as follows, in this order:
        <ol class="nested">
          <li>to charity - there is a tradition that a percentage of our annual collection is given to charity. At least this percentage of the total funds must be donated to a charity, either as agreed at the GM or to the last charity in receipt of team funds before the team folded. The EGM may decide to increase the percentage up to and including 100% but it may not donate less than the traditional percentage.</li>
          <li>to members - all members may receive an amount not exceeding their last annual subscription payment. The GM may not increase this limit but has the power to reduce this payment "pro-rata", i.e. by that proportion of the subscription that corresponds to the proportion of the calendar year (subscriptions take effect from Jan 1st) that has already elapsed.</li>
          <li>any remaining funds to be donated to the Morris Federation with a request that it be used to preserve and make available the team's dance repertoire, visual record (photographs, scrapbooks etc), and team archive in that order.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Digital assets, including documents, photographs and website, together with any copyright or intellectual property therein shall be archived and the archive offered to the Morris Federation. Team accounts with social media (etc.) shall be closed down.</li>
